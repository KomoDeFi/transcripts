good morning comedians in today's video
we're going to cover how to create a
block explorer for your komodo smart
chain
if you haven't created a smart chain yet
you can check out the first video in
this series linked in the description
and installing the block explorer isn't
too difficult uh thanks to the work done
we'll just uh
use this simple repository
follow the steps from the readme and it
really should only take us about 10
minutes
so the first thing we want to do is to
stop our smart chain
i'm using the rock smart chain that i
created in the last tutorial
the reason we're stopping the smart
chain is because as we run through the
installation of the block explorer uh
some parameters in the conf file will be
changed
and we'll need to restart the chain with
a ring index so that those additional
parameters will take effect so once
we've stopped the smart chain
we'll just
clone that repository
onto our server
and enter the folder that it's in
and we've got a very simple script here
which will grab all the dependencies and
set up everything that we need to run
the explorer so again just a simple copy
paste
the setup explorer directory shell
script
we'll have to enter our sudo password so
that we can open the correct ports and
and this will take two or three minutes
so chance to go grab yourself a coffee
pat the dog
once that's finished you'll see that
there's a subdirectory called node
modules
that has installed all the dependencies
and the next shell script
will give it a parameter that is the
name of our smart chain
it will detect our conf file
modified accordingly
and prepare our chain for usage on the
explorer
so before we run this one we'll just
have a quick look at the existing conf
file as we set it up in tutorial one
and you can see there we've got our rpc
user password port a few other bits and
pieces and we added the pub key and add
node to the bottom and now we'll run
that
install asset chain explorer script
and once that's done we'll have another
look at the conf file to see how it was
changed so as you can see it's removed
our pub key and add node
parameters and it's added a few extra
ones which allow it to communicate with
the explorer
and also a few parameters which
store more information about the
blockchain on our local drive now that
that script has completed
open up and edit the conf file again so
that we can re-add our pub key and add
node
and then we'll save and exit that last
little script created a folder
specifically for our smart chains
including a script which will start the
explorer for us
and now we are ready to launch
our smart chain again
but i won't use the launch script just
yet i'll just copy the launch string and
we'll put dash re-index at the end
and that'll update our chain data with
the extra information such as the
address index time stamp index etc
which is used by the block explorer to
display more information about what has
been happening on the chain now if
you're doing this on an established
chain that has been running for a while
a re-index might take some time
but because i only just created this
smart chain a couple of days ago
the re-index should complete
in less than a minute
next we'll have a look at the rock web
access file
which tells us where we need to go to
have a look at the explorer and you can
see there that's the ip address of the
server that i'm using and the port that
has been assigned for the explorer and
now that we have that we will launch the
explorer with the rock dash explorer
start script
there we go so we can copy that url from
the web access file
head back to our browser
enter it in
and there you go we've got a block
explorer by default the block explorer
will reference komodo
all over the place
so there is a little bit of extra
customization to be done
i'll show you a couple of simple
customizations to begin with
but you can go much further with
customized css
to change the color of elements
and any other creative changes that you
may have in mind the files you need to
tweak in order to implement some
customization are under your chain
explorer node modules
insight dash ui komodo public folder
first one we'll have a look at is in the
javascript
so you can see we have a main.js and a
main.min.js
the explorer will use the minified file
so i'll just open that up unfortunately
this file is all squashed together so
it's not really nicely readable for
humans
but one thing that we can do is
and we've got a few
minifier and unminifier tools you can
just search for online
just copy it in there hit unminify and
you can see it's all nicely laid out for
and we can copy that again
head back to our editor
so you can see at the top here we have
the net symbol variable which is set to
kmd at the moment and that is used as
the default currency
which is why when we have a look on the
explorer page we have kmd at the top
here and we also have it after any
amounts that have been transacted
so i'm just going to change that to my
and i'll save that file
and now if we
exit and restart
see now that everything is counted in
rock
the next thing you might want to change
is the logo at the top here
and it's named
logo.png
and if we open that up at the moment
we'll see the old komodo logo there so
i'm just going to copy one that i
created myself
and overwrite that one and again once
we've updated that file
we can stop and restart
refresh our page
and now my logo is in effect you might
also want to change things like the
background or text color
and all of that is defined within the
css files
which we can find
in the public
and again these are minified files so
i'll just open up
main.min.css
and to make it a little bit easier to
work with again i'll copy the bit that
is not a comment
head on over to a
unminifier
hit the unminify button and there we go
we've got nice beautiful
human readable css
and i'll just replace that in that file
there to find out the name of the
element you are trying to change most
modern browsers support something like
inspect
and with that we can have a look at the
code that has created the page
and if we click on a specific
element
it'll highlight down there it'll tell us
which css styles have influenced the
color the size the font and so on of
this element so
for example here
see what it looks like or perhaps i want
get the hex value down the bottom there
and it tells me that this is defined in
main.min.css file and it also tells me
which selector within that file will
need to be edited any edits that we've
just done while we're in this identify
view they'll not persist if i was to
reload the page again
it'll go back to default this is just a
handy little tool that we can test
things out with
see what maybe a different uh background
color would look like and and how the
contrast goes against the text
but if we actually want to make that
change permanent we'll have to change it
in that main dot min dot css file so for
example now if i want to change the main
background
to something a bit darker and copy that
you can see it's the body selector that
i'm looking for so head back to my
main.css file
so we can see the body selector here
although that doesn't have a background
color declaration
so we might just have to have a look
further into the css file and there we
go
we see that we
update it with our value save the file
stop the explorer
restart it
and you can see that now that change is
permanent
and from here it's just a matter of
rinse and repeat
update the elements that you want to
change
and once you're happy you'll have
a fully functional
customized
block explorer and that brings us to the
end of this tutorial in the next
tutorial of this series we'll show you
how to set up an electrum server before
we can list our new coin
on atomic decks desktop
